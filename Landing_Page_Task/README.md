# Kick Interactive Frontend Developer Exercise

Hello, if you've been sent this exercise then we would like to better understand how you work, to do this we'd like you to undertake a small assignment.

At Kick Interactive we build a number of sites from scratch. All our sites are developed using PHP as the primary language but as a Frontend Developer you will mainly be using HTML, CSS and JavaScript to turn designs into fully functioning websites.

### Below is a brief outlining the requirements of the exercise:

- You will be supplied a single page design, as well as the assets exported separately. Fork or download these assets from this repo.

- From this you need to build a single page using HTML and CSS. You can easily do this on your local machine by creating an index.html page and dragging it into your browser.

- The page will need to match the design as accurately as possible, pay close attention to detail.

- The navigation will need to link and scroll to each related section on the page. Maybe think about using JavaScript.

- Additional functionality like scrolling banners, hover states and button effects have been left to your imagination.

- Feel free to add additional functionality to show what you can do. Remember Responsiveness is a must, and think about optimising images for the web.

- Once complete, please upload your work either as a pull request or as a public project on your profile and email to let us know.

Good Luck!
